<p>Hi, I'm Travis.  I have a BA in Film and Digital Media from UC Santa Cruz.  By day I work in video production and post-production and by night I am learning full-stack web development. This blog is intended to document my tech projects and learning.</p>

<p>I am also a photographer, sometimes by trade but mostly by passion! Check out some of my work on <a href="http://thetacobelljar.com">my photo blog</a> or <a href="https://instagram.com/tbaugh/">Instragram</a>.</p>

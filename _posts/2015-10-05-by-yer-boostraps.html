title: By yer Bootstrap(s)
---

<p>I've completed my first project with this blog, adding <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>.  Boostrap is a front-end framework that makes it really easy to rapidly layout and style websites.  I've touched Boostrap a couple times in doing Rails tutorials, but this was the first time I've tried using it with a different sort of project and without following a set tutorial.</p>

<p>However that isn't to say that I didn't use some instructions!  Because of some funky stuff with the way Jekyll works on Github we aren't able to install Bootstrap the normal way.  I found <a href="http://veithen.github.io/2015/03/26/jekyll-bootstrap.html">this blog post</a> written by Github user <a href="https://github.com/veithen">veithen</a> to be quite helpful.  You use <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass">the Sass port</a> rather than a traditional installation.</p>

<p>This little project was pretty easy but definitely required a little bit of trouble shooting and Googling to get through.  Now to learn more about working with Bootstrap.</p>

title: More Adventures in Technology
---

<p>Since my last blog post I have been making more progress in learning the ways of web development in technology outside the rubric of The Odin Project.  Once I implemented Bootstrap on this blog I realized that I didn't quite understand exactly how it worked or the benefit of using it (other than the responsiveness and ability to quickly make modern looking sites). To learn more about Bootstrap and refresh some of the front-end concepts I learned with The Odin Project I decided to check out <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a>.</p>

<p>Free Code Camp (or FCC) is very simliar to The Odin Project, both are open-source approaches to teaching full-stack web development online.  Free Code Camp focuses on development with node.js rather than Ruby on Rails and provides volunteer work opprotunities with non-profits for students (aka "campers") who complete the curriculum.  Through the FCC curriculum I've made <a href="http://codepen.io/tbaugh/pen/epwowO">a mock-portfolio page on CodePen</a> and soon will complete a few more projects to really hammer in the Bootstrap and jQuery I've learned.</p>

<p>But more exciting than all that is that I have finally completed a project that I have been wanting to attempt for quite some time now: making a web server with a Raspberry Pi!  I got a Pi months ago and have used it mostly as a media center using <a href="http://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a>, a temporary radio broadcaster using <a href="https://github.com/rm-hull/pifm">Pi FM</a>, and to make LED lights blink.  Now my Pi is an Apache server hosting this blog to the greater internet (albeit at an undisclosed address), which I think is pretty nifty. I followed <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/06/27/raspberry-pi-web-server-website-hosting">Lauren Orsini's tutorial on ReadWrite</a> to accomplish the task.</p>

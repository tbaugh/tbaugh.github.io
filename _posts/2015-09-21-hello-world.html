title: Hello, world.

<h1>Hello, world.</h1>  
<p>My name’s Travis and I’m an aspiring web developer.  It feels a bit odd to say that after having already completed a degree and working in an industry for a few years, but I’m becoming more and more interested in the web each day and have decided to focus on developing skills in this exciting field.</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I got my first taste of making websites and browsing the internet in about the 5th grade, however it wasn’t until recently, now well into my 20s, that I ever really knew more than how to mark up a blog post, upload via FTP, or create simple HTML pages with a little CSS and some cut/paste Javascript.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the year I’ve been slowy working my way through <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, an open-source online bootcamp focusing on full-stack web development with Ruby on Rails.  It's been a challenge working through the curriculum while maintaining a full-time job, social life, and other hobbies, but it is quite rewarding.</p>

<h1>The Purpose of This Blog</h1>
<p>I started this blog for a few reasons.  First, I have the day off today and wanted to do something productive to start my day, I'd heard the name <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> a few times before and thought I'd give it a shot. Most importatnly I wanted a space to record my educational journey or store all the tid-bits of inspiration I find along the way. If anything this will just be a good place to look back on if I get confused about how I executed some project later. </p>

<h1>But if I'm learning Rails..?</h1>
<p>I decided on jekyll vs. Rails for this blog in part because I've already made <a href="https://github.com/tbaugh/blogger">a blog in Rails</a> as part of The Odin Project and there is something to be said for learning new things. But also jekyll seems perfect for my intentions.  Rails just seems like overkill for a small personal site where I just want to throw up some HTML.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>So until I have something more interesting to talk about, this post will be a testing area as I learn more.</p>
